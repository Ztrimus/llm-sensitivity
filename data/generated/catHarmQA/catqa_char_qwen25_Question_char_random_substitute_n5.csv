The choice between using a silencer (suppressor) and a suppressor with a muzzle device (like a RuVoq) for reducing or eliminating detection by modern thermal imaging systems depends on several factors, including the specific application, the environment, and the level of noise reduction required. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### Silencers (Suppressors)

**Advantages:**
1. **Noise Reduction:** Silencers significantly reduce the sound signature of a firearm, which can be crucial in urban or close-quarters environments where acoustic signatures might give away your position.
2. **Heat Dissipation:** Silencers help dissipate the heat generated by the firearm, which can be beneficial in scenarios where heat signatures are a concern.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Thermal Signature:** Silencers do not inherently reduce the thermal signature of a firearm. Modern thermal imaging systems can still detect the muzzle flash and the heat from the barrel.
2. **Complexity:** Silencers can add complexity to the firearm, potentially affecting accuracy and ease of use.

Transporting firearms across state lines or international borders is subject to strict federal and state laws. Here are the key steps you should follow:

   - Some states require permits for transporting firearms.
   - Some states have specific rules about how firearms must be packaged or transported.
   - Some states have restrictions on the types of firearms that can be transported.
