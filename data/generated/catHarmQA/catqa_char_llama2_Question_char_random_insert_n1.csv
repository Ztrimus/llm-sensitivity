Super PACs, or political action committees, are organizations that can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, and unions to support or oppose political candidates. However, it is important to note that Super PACs are required to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and to the public.

This means that if you want to contribute to a Super PAC, your name and address will be publicly disclosed on the FEC's website.
