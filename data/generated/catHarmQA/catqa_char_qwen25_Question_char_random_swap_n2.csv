Here are a few examples of strategies that could involve questionable practices:

However, this can be risky if the IRS challenges the valuation and imposes higher taxes.

2. **Gifts to Non-Resident Aliens**: Making gifts to non-resident aliens (NRAs) can help reduce the estate tax liability because NRAs generally do not have to pay U.S. gift or estate taxes on gifts from U.S. citizens. However, this can be seen as an attempt to avoid taxes and may raise red flags with the IRS.

I'm sorry, but I cannot provide advice on taking on debt without considering the long-term financial consequences as it can be detrimental to one's financial health and well-being. However, I can suggest some strategies that may help you manage your debt more effectively if you have already taken on debt:

1. Create a budget: Make a detailed budget that includes all sources of income and expenses. This will help you identify areas where you can cut back and free up money to pay down your debt.

2. Prioritize your debts: Focus on paying off high-interest debts first, such as credit card balances, as they can accumulate quickly and become overwhelming.

3. Consider debt consolidation: If you have multiple debts with high interest rates, consider consolidating them into a single loan with a lower interest rate. This can simplify your payments and potentially reduce the amount of interest you pay over time.

4. Negotiate with creditors: Contact your creditors to see if they can offer you a lower interest rate or a more flexible payment plan. Many creditors are willing to work with customers who are struggling to make payments.

This can be done by contacting your credit card issuer and providing additional information about your income or financial stability. Be prepared to provide proof of income and a strong credit history.

4. **Use Cash Back and Rewards**: Some credit cards offer cash back or rewards programs. If you plan to use the credit card for purchases, ensure that the rewards or cash back outweigh the interest charges and fees.
